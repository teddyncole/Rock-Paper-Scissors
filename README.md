# Rock-Paper-Scissors

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a rock paper scissors game I am creating using Python. It contains a Player class with various subclasses that let the player oppose a computer player that will choose different options including one that always plays rock, one that cycles through each option, one that reflects what the other previously played, and one player that chose a move at random.
 
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Downloading the file and opening it in the terminal will allow you to play the game.</p>
