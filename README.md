# Rock-Paper-Scissors

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a rock paper scissors game I am creating using Python. It contains a Player class with various subclasses that let the player oppose a computer player that will choose different options including one that always plays rock and one that cycles through each option.
 
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Downloading the file and opening it in the terminal will allow you to play the game.</p>
